# Left X axis basic kinematics
I’ve finished the basic kinematics for the X-axis. The design includes a slider that runs on V-Slot wheels there's also a belt tensioner for adjustment. The motion system is uses a NEM1 17 stepper motor and a 10 mm GT2 belt, which is routed both inside the 2040 extrusion and along its exterior to help reduce the overall footprint. The NEMA 17 stepper motor mount currently in use isn’t ideal and will likely need improvement in the future. The slider top and the Y-axis extrusion clamp on the belt and  secure the belts in place. Finally, the feet of the assembly are designed to be screwed into a large MDF base, which helps keep the overall cost low.
